<h3>Racial Harmony Day</h3>

<p>Our PSG EXCO planned activities and games for the students to participate in on Racial Harmony Day. Amongst the activities conducted are paper cutting, picking auspicious ornaments using chopsticks, making ‘bunga manggar’ and wedding ‘can bells’, throwing the bouquet, henna-drawing and silver pot games. The students had fun participating in these activities.</p>
