#### International Friendship Day

Our PSG EXCO planned activities and games for the students based on the theme - Celebrating the ASEAN Community. The students learned the importance of bonding and friendship through recess activities such as making friendship bands, batik painting of ASEAN flowers and playing games such as chapteh, zero point and congkak. Students also penned down messages for their friends.
