#### Empowering Families Through Family Matters!  

Because FAMILY matters. Our family is the anchor in our lives, bringing us love, joy and warmth. Our family supports us, keeps us rooted and gives meaning to our existence. A happy family does not just happen. It takes effort and commitment. FamilyMatters! empowers you with the resources, knowledge and skills to build a strong, happy family. We partner schools, workplaces and community partners to bring these resources closer to you at each life stage. We also work with businesses to create a family friendly environment for you and your family.

FamilyMatters@School equips parents and young adults with skills to nurture positive family relationships. We work closely with schools, parents support groups and parent volunteers os that parents can easily access family education programmes that help them better connect with their children. We also work with local universities that reach out to young adults, helping them improve their social and relationship skills.
