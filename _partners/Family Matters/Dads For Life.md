#### Forest Adventure

This programme allows children to discover the thrill of height and the joy of physical outdoor activity. Many children will have to push their limits and move out of their comfort zone, only to feel very proud of themselves once they completed the course.  

The Dad must lead his child to the right trees where he or she will have access to a board with a set of multiple choice answers. It is also an opportunity for parents and child to practice the sporting attitudes of encouragement, sportsmanship, and resilience with one another.

 This is a great opportunity for child and dad to boost their confidence in a fun and safe way.
