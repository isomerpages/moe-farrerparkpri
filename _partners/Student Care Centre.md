### afterschool by NTUC First Campus
  
afterschool by NTUC First Campus was started in 2016 to meet working families’ demand for reliable, quality student care. Based within primary schools, afterschool provides a continuum of care for children after their school hours.  
  
afterschool provides students with engaging experiences that develop them holistically, balancing between academic and co-academic within a home-like environment. The programme and activities are designed to complement and align to the objectives set out in MOE’s Primary School Curriculum and each school’s vision, mission and values so that students can benefit from an integrated learning experience throughout the school-year. They are committed to providing children with a joyful afterschool experience with a myriad of experiential activities, guided homework supervision, healthy meals provision under the utmost love and care by a team of qualified teachers.

**Vision**
