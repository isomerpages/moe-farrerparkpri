Dear Parents,  
  
Please visit this page for Home-based Learning activities at Farrer Park Primary School. Home-based Learning (HBL) is not confined to E-learning and may include offline work that involves reading or writing.  
  
#### HBL To Be Announced Soon

  

#### Common issues and how to resolve them
 

**1) Forgotten password or locked out of SLS, Google Classroom etc.**

Please fill in this form: <a href="https://go.gov.sg/fppshelpdesk" target="_blank"> FPPS Helpdesk</a>
  
**2) Forgotten email address or login id for SLS or Google Classroom**

With effect from Jan 2023, student iCON email (MIMS) will be used for SLS login ID.
For example,  
  
Tan Xiao Ming has a MIMS ID of **TAN_XIAO_MING@students.edu.sg**  

All our school account IDs (Google, Koobits) take reference from this MIMS ID. 

**3) The HBL page is not updating.**

During the HBL period, our HBL page is updated every morning by **7.00am**. Click on the refresh button on your browser. It might require you to click a few times.  
  
Alternatively, you could also try clearing your browser cache. Here is a link to a website that shows you how to do this. ([**Link**](https://www.downing.nz/simple-steps-to-refresh-your-website-browser-cache/))  
  
**4) We don't see the HBL activities for the previous days.**
All instructions for previous HBL activities are consolidated on our [**Past Home-based Learning**](https://www.farrerparkpri.moe.edu.sg/for-parents/home-based-learning/past-home-based-learning) page located on the the navigation bar on the top left of out HBL page.
