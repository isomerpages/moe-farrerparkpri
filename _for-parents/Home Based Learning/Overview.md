#### Common issues and how to resolve them
 

**1) Forgotten password or locked out of SLS, Google Classroom etc.**

Please fill in this form: <a href="https://go.gov.sg/fppshelpdesk" target="_blank"> FPPS Helpdesk</a>
  
**2) Forgotten email address or login id for SLS or Google Classroom**

With only a few exceptions, SLS IDs are constructed from the first five characters of the student's name, followed by the last five characters of their birth certificate. For example,  
  
Tan Xiao Ming (BC No. T1234567B) has a SLS ID of **TANXI4567B**  

All our school account IDs (Google, Koobits and MyON) take reference from this SLS ID.  
Google account email: **TANXI4567B@farrerparkpri,moe.edu.sg**  

**3) The HBL page is not updating.**

During the HBL period, our HBL page is updated every morning by **7.00am**. Click on the refresh button on your browser. It might require you to click a few times.  
  
Alternatively, you could also try clearing your browser cache. Here is a link to a website that shows you how to do this. ([**Link**](https://www.downing.nz/simple-steps-to-refresh-your-website-browser-cache/))  
  
**4) We don't see the HBL activities for the previous days.**
All instructions for previous HBL activities are consolidated on our [**Past Home-based Learning**](https://www.farrerparkpri.moe.edu.sg/for-parents/home-based-learning/past-home-based-learning) page located on the the navigation bar on the top left of out HBL page.
