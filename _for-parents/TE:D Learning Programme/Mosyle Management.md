<h3 style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Managing your Child's Learning Device with Screenguide</h3>

<img alt="Screenguide Illustration" src="/images/ict7.png" style="width:30%; margin-bottom: 15px;">

<p>
Farrer Park Primary School uses Mobile Device Management software, <strong>Mosyle</strong>, to manage students’ iPad learning device usage and screen time. This software enables the school and parents to monitor and manage the child’s device remotely.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 25px;">Managing your Child's Device</h4>

<p>
To work in partnership with our parents, Farrer Park Primary School offers two options for managing learning devices under the TE:D programme.
</p>

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; margin-top: 20px;">
  <img alt="Option 1 Icon" style="width:50px; height:50px; margin-right:15px;" src="/images/ict8.png">
  <div>
    <strong>Option 1: Management in Partnership with Parents</strong><br>
    School-managed on weekdays from <strong>7.00am to 1.30pm</strong><br>
    <strong>Lunch Break:</strong> 1.30pm – 2.00pm (iPad will be locked from all apps)<br>
    Parent-managed using Screenguide after 2.00pm<br>
    <br>
    *School holidays are fully managed by parents.

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; margin-top: 25px;">
  <img alt="Option 2 Icon" style="width:50px; height:50px; margin-right:15px;" src="/images/ict9.png">
  <div>
    <strong>Option 2: School Managed</strong><br>
    Weekdays (School Profile): <strong>7.00am to 1.30pm</strong><br>
    <strong>Lunch Break:</strong> 1.30pm – 2.00pm (iPad will be locked from all apps)<br>
    Learning apps available for self-directed learning: <strong>2.00pm to 5.30pm</strong><br>
    After 5.30pm: all apps will be locked<br>
    Weekend/School Holidays: <strong>7.00am to 11.00am</strong> and <strong>2.00pm to 5.30pm</strong><br>
    <br>
    *Note: The school profile only shows learning apps. If parents would like to allow personal app usage, please <a href="https://form.gov.sg/63bf4675994d6d00122c4bf2" target="_blank">click here</a> to opt for Option 1.

<p style="margin-top: 25px;">
In both Option 1 and 2, the school ensures that all required learning apps are installed and updated.
</p>

<p>
To promote a healthy balance of screen time and rest, Option 2 provides students with access after school until 5.30pm, as well as two screen time blocks on weekends and holidays (7.00am to 11.00am, and 2.00pm to 5.30pm).
</p>

<p>
However, to maximise the benefits of their learning devices, we strongly encourage parents to choose <strong>Option 1</strong>. This allows us to collaborate more closely in nurturing healthy digital habits both in school and at home.
</p>

<p>
To activate Option 1, parents must install and set up the Screenguide app for iPad monitoring. Please <a href="https://www.farrerparkpri.moe.edu.sg/ict/Manage-your-Childs-Device/installing-and-using-screenguide/" target="_blank">click here</a> for the installation and user guide.
