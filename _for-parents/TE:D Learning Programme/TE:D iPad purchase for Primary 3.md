### Getting the iPad for your child

We recommend that you consider purchasing the following items from any vendor of your choosing.  
  

*   iPad (10.2-inch) 64GB WiFi - Base model
*   Additional 2 Year AppleCare+ Protection Plan
*   Screen Protector
*   Protective Case

At this time there is **no need** to purchase a detachable keyboard or Apple pencil/stylus.  
There are also many options for screen protectors and protective cases on online portals or other vendors.  
  
For product information please visit [**https://www.apple.com/sg/ipad/**](https://www.apple.com/sg/ipad/)  
  
**Please note that you do not need to purchase a new iPad for your child for the programme.**   
  

#### FAQ

**Question 1: Can I use an iPad Mini?**<br>
We do not recommend the iPad Mini due to its limited screen space which presents difficulties for your child's eye health and might also make it challenging for your child to use during lessons.   
The recommended model iPad is also priced lower.  
  
**Question 2:** **What is the MDM? And Screen guide?**<br>
The Mobile Device Management (MDM) and the accompanying Screen Guide applications are third-party paid software that allows the school and parents to manage the child's device remotely to manage the installed applications and monitor screen time. The school will bear the cost of this software.  
More information on how parents can use this MDM can be found **[here](https://www.farrerparkpri.moe.edu.sg/farrerean-experience/ict/managing-your-childs-learning-device-with-screenguide)**.  
  
**Question 3:** **Must I get the iPad 9th Gen (10.2-inch WiFi 64GB)?  
**This learning device will be used by your child for the next 4 years and technology refreshes rapidly. We recommend that parents get the latest technology available to ensure usability over the entire length of this use. Parents can choose to not get this iPad but minimally, should opt for an iPad that supports **iOS 13**.  
  
**Question 4:** **When should my child bring the iPad to school?  
**Your child can bring in their iPad for the installation of the MDM software from  **(Monday 21 March 2022).**For those purchasing through AsiaPac Technology Pte. Ltd., orders will be consolidated and and delivered to school. We will inform you when your child's iPad has been delivered.  
  
Please note that the iPad will be **reset to factory settings** for the installation of the MDM software.  
Parents will need to ensure that the **iPad does not have any AppleID signed in**.  
  
**Question 5:** **Will my child be using their iPad in school in directly after the installation?  
**After the installation of the MDM software, which might take up to a week, the iPad will be handed over to the class Form Teachers to be returned to your child. They will be able to use their own iPad in school and will be bringing them to school and back home on a daily basis.  
  
Until we have an opportunity to engage you on using Screenguide to monitor your child's iPad use at home, the P3 level will be placed on a school-managed profile. Please refer to **Question 4** for more information on Screenguide and the School MDM.
