<ol style="font-size: 16px; padding-left: 20px;">
  <li>
    <strong>Will my child be able to change the setting on their own?</strong><br>
    No. The child will not be able to change any settings set by their parents using ScreenGuide.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Can we restrict certain applications to a particular time as opposed to blocking the apps?</strong><br>
    Yes. Parents can use Screen Time or Restrict to Specific Apps to manage their child's activities.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>I can’t effectively control my child’s iPad with functions like Time Limit and app restrictions.</strong><br>
    Parents can search for YouTube tutorials (username: SingaporeMDM Device Management) or seek help from school via email or phone. The school will respond within 2 to 3 working days.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Is ScreenGuide supported on Android phones?</strong><br>
    Yes. The ScreenGuide app is available on both iOS App Store and Google Play Store. You can also manage ScreenGuide via a web browser:

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Can parents use ScreenGuide to control a child’s smartphone screen time while at work?</strong><br>
    No. Parents can only use ScreenGuide to manage the child’s iPad enrolled by Farrer Park Primary School. Personal devices cannot be managed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>How do I fully restrict inappropriate content and searches?</strong><br>
    It is not possible to fully restrict inappropriate content, but parents can remove access to the Safari browser.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>How do I block YouTube after school hours and online gaming websites?</strong><br>
    Parents can use the "Restrict to Specific Apps" feature to block applications like YouTube.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>What can I do if my child is unwilling to part from the iPad?</strong><br>
    Parents can use the Time-Out feature or physically remove the iPad to keep it safe.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>I want to install other apps like Trend Micro Guardian, but it's not in Mosyle. What do I do?</strong><br>
    Parents can install other iPad apps via the Apple App Store using their own Apple ID. The Mosyle catalog includes only school-approved apps.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The settings I updated are not being applied to the iPad. What should I do?</strong><br>
    ScreenGuide is network dependent. Check for pending commands in the app and try canceling/resending if necessary. Ensure both devices have an active Internet connection. If issues persist, contact the school.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>My child uses airplane mode to bypass restrictions. What can I do?</strong><br>
    Use the Screen Time feature, which requires interaction before use. This helps prevent misuse of airplane mode.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Can I “Select All” school apps to be shown with personal apps outside school hours?</strong><br>
    No. Parents must manually select each app.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Can I set time limits on specific apps?</strong><br>
    No. ScreenGuide does not allow usage-based time limits. You can allow apps only during a specific time block.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Will my home screen app folders stay the same between school and personal settings?</strong><br>
    No. App arrangements reset when switching between settings.
