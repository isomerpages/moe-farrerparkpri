### Managing your Child's Learning Device with Screenguide

<img src="/images/ict7.png" style="width:30%">

Farrer Park Primary School incorporated Mobile Device Management software, Mosyle, to manage our students’ iPad learning device usage as well as screen time. This powerful software allow school and parents to monitor and manage the child’s device remotely.  

Managing your Child's Device  
To work in partnership with our parents, Farrer Park Primary School has two options for the management of learning devices for the TE:D programme.

2.00pm to 6.00pm  
Other times locked.  
  
In both Option 1 and 2, the school will ensure that the apps needed for learning in the classroom are installed and updated.  
  
To ensure that our students have a good balance of screen time and rest, option 2 allows our students access to their learning devices after school till 6.00pm as well as two three-hour blocks on weekends as well as during school holidays in the morning and afternoon.  
    
In order to maximise the potential of their learning devices, we highly recommend that our parents choose option 1, which will allow us to work in partnership to develop good learning device habits in our children both in school and at home.  
  
To activate option 1, parents only need to activate the Screenguide app for monitoring and control of their child’s iPad. All learning devices that have not yet had Screenguide activated will be placed on option 2 by default. You may refer to the link on the left for Installation and usage guide.
