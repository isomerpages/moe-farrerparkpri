2\. During the **FIRST** login, you will be prompted to change your password **(refer to Fig. 1b).** You will need to key in your new password twice. Please note that the password must contain alphanumeric characters and is **case-sensitive**. It should: 

a.     be **12** **characters or longer**;

b.     contain **at least 1 letter and 1 digit**; and

c.     be **changed every year** (you will be directed to the change password page automatically)

4\. After you have changed your password, you will be prompted with an option to enter an email address in the “**Password Reset Email Address**” field **(refer to Fig. 1c)**. Note that this email address will be used if you have forgotten the password and require assistance to reset it.

A verification code will be sent to this email address. Key in the verification code into the prompt. The code is only valid for 10 minutes.

5\. The next step would be to set up the Security Questions. You will **need to answer these Questions** to verify that you are the legitimate account holder when you need to perform a password reset via self-help or by calling Helpdesk.
