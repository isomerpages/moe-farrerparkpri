Dear Parents,  
  
Please visit this page for Self-Directed Learning (SDL) activities at Farrer Park Primary School. 

#### Common issues and how to resolve them
 

**1) Forgotten password or locked out of SLS, Google Classroom etc.**

Please fill in this form:&nbsp;<a href="https://go.gov.sg/fppshelpdesk" target="_blank"> FPPS Helpdesk</a>
  
**2) Forgotten email address or login id for SLS or Google Classroom**

With effect from Jan 2023, student iCON email (MIMS) will be used for SLS login ID.
For example,  
  
Tan Xiao Ming has a MIMS ID of&nbsp;**TAN_XIAO_MING@students.edu.sg**  

All our school account IDs (Google, Koobits) take reference from this MIMS ID.
