Children are naturally curious and like to explore and ask questions. In their journey of acquiring scientific knowledge and skills, we provide different opportunities for our students to experience learning in meaningful and authentic settings through individual and collaborative effort.

Anchored at the heart of Teaching and Learning of Science is the use of scientific investigation to help our students strengthen their theoretical and practical underpinnings of acquisition and application of scientific concepts in the real-life context. This paves the way for every student to be able to construct logical scientific explanations at each milestone checkpoint accurately and confidently and be ready for graduation at the end of their 6-year primary education.
