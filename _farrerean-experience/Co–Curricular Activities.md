### CCA


CCAs are an essential part of a Farrereans’ holistic education. They are an integral part of a well-rounded education and play an important role in nurturing good character. They provide a natural platform for Farrereans to learn and apply values, knowledge and skills. Farrereans develop these values and character while they uncover their talents and competencies as they ready themselves for a rapidly changing world. They foster friendships as they learn, play and grow together.
