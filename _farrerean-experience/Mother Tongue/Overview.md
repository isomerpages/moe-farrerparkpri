### Overview of Mother Tongue

<img src="/images/mt1.png" style="width:80%">

At Farrer Park Primary School, we aim at providing a holistic education whereby every child will be able to master listening, speaking, reading, writing and communication skills in their MTL and appreciate his/her culture.  
The Mother Tongue Department at Farrer Park Primary School provides a linguistically rich and vibrant cultural environment for pupils to attain these skills.  
These are the key programmes at Farrer Park Primary School for the 3 Mother Tongue Languages:

| Programmes | Description |
|:---:|:---:|
| Process Drama | <br>P1-P4 pupils go through process drama to build language skills, particularly in oracy and listening skills. This programme allows interaction among pupils, exploring issues and problems at hand and brings out different pupils’ perspectives through drama strategies. At the same time, it emphasizes the teaching of positive values.  |
| Reading Programme | This school wide reading programme aims to build up pupils’ interest in reading Mother Tongue books. Post-reading activities are conducted after pupils completed reading the MT story books.  |
| MTL Language Fortnight | The MTL Fortnight aims to create an immersive environment for our pupils in their learning of the Mother Tongue language and culture. During the 2 weeks programme, a variety of cultural and language activities related to the Mother Tongue languages are organised for pupils.  These activities provide platforms for students to actively learn MT and the associated culture so as to experience MT as a ‘living language’. |
| MT Cultural Camp | P6 pupils participate in activities related to Mother Tongue language and culture in this annual day camp. Activities include artefact making, playing traditional games and quizzes.  |
| CPES<br><br>(only CL pupils) | <br>To cultivate the interest of pupils in cultural performances and in learning the Chinese language, pupils attend suitable theatre plays at public performance arts venues outside of school. |
