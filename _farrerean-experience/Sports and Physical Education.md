### Sports and Physical Education

At Farrer Park, a structured and progressive physical education curriculum provides each Farrerean the ability toÂ use a range of skills to participate in a variety of exercises and physical activities.

In the field or on the court, a Farrerean applies the concepts, principles and strategies that had been deliberated in PE lessons. A Farrerean internalises the values and ethics he learns. With these, he honours and respects himself, his peers and his environment. Ultimately, a Farrerean walks into the world with the tools to enjoy a healthy and active life.

The Sports Fiesta presents Farrereans with the Exposure to being challenged, the Experience to succeed, and chance to taste Excellence.

The Farrerean is developed holistically. The PE curriculum creates opportunities for them to uncover their talents and develop their potential.
