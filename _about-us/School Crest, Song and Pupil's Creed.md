<h3>School Crest</h3>
<img src="/images/crest.png" style="width:30%">
<p>The <strong>open book</strong> represents the key to knowledge and learning.</p>
<p>The <strong>growing plant</strong> depicts a child upholding the school's spirit of creativity, courage and flexibility.</p>
<p>The <strong>three leaves</strong> represent the School, Parent and Community.</p>
<p>Together they remind us that education is an <strong>on-going process, best maximized</strong> through the partnership.</p>

<h3>Our School Song</h3>
<figure>
    Like a plant<br>
    We will grow<br>
    Blossoming each day<br>
    We will do our best in every way<br>
    We can be who we want to be<br>
    By working hard<br><br>
    With a caring heart,<br>
    Curiosity and empathy<br>
    Here at Farrer Park Primary<br>
    We’re challenged to be<br>
    The someone we are proud to call me<br><br>
    We will care<br>
    We will share<br>
    Helping those in need<br>
    We will do our best in every deed<br>
    We can be who we want to be<br>
    By working hard<br><br>
    With a caring heart,<br>
    Curiosity and empathy<br>
    Here at Farrer Park Primary<br>
    We’re challenged to be<br>
    The someone we are proud to call me<br>
    Here at Farrer Park Primary
