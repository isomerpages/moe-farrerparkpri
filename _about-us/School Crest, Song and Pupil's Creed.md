### School Crest

<img src="/images/crest.png" style="width:40%">

The&nbsp;**open book**&nbsp;represents the key to knowledge and learning.

The&nbsp;**growing plant**&nbsp;depicts a child upholding the school's spirit of creativity, courage and flexibility.

The&nbsp;**three leaves**&nbsp;represent the School, Parent and Community.

Together they remind us that education is an&nbsp;**on-going process, best maximized**&nbsp;through the partnership.

### Our School Song

<figure>Like a plant<br>
We will grow<br>
Blossoming each day<br>
We will do our best in every way<br>
We can be who we want to be<br>
By working hard<br>

With a caring heart,<br>
Curiosity and empathy<br>
Here at&nbsp;Farrer&nbsp;Park Primary<br>
We’re challenged to be<br>
The someone we are proud to call me<br>

We will care<br>
We will share<br>
Helping those in&nbsp;need<br>
We will do our best in every&nbsp;deed<br>
We can be who we want to be<br>
By working hard<br>
  

With a caring heart,<br>
Curiosity and empathy<br>
Here at&nbsp;Farrer&nbsp;Park Primary<br>
We’re challenged to be<br>
The someone we are proud to call me<br>
Here at&nbsp;Farrer&nbsp;Park Primary</figure>
