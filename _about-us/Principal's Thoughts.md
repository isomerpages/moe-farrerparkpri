<h3>Principal's Thoughts</h3><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:45%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/20230203_183235_0000.jpg"></div><p><br>Dear Parents,</p><p>As we welcome the new year of 2023, may the year bring us much joy and peace!</p><p>Farrer Park Primary School Version 2.0 (FPPS 2.0) is an amalgamation of 9 schools over 7 decades as depicted in the mural below. <br></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/p_thoughts_2024_pic_1.png"></div><p>Just like the lyrics of the school song, the school is like a plant that has grown to become a big strong tree supported by the deep roots of the 9 schools which formed its heritage. I am glad to be part of this rich heritage having had the privilege of being a Principal of 2 other schools. Together with the Vice-Principals, Key Personnels, Teachers and support staff all with very rich and diverse experiences, we strive to give our children a balanced and holistic educational experience that will prepare them for a life of learning and thriving, that every child would be “A Fountain of Knowledge” with a “Heart of Gold” as espoused by the school’s Vision, anchored on the school Values of Curiosity, Empathy and Care.</p><p>I look forward to the new year. May we enter 2024 with a great sense of anticipation and hope, anchored on Values, working towards the Vison of the school.</p><p>In your service,</p><p>Dennis Yap</p><p>Principal</p>
