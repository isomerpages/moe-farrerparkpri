    We bade farewell to 2024 on a high note. The school has ended 2024 very well. We were very encouraged by our PSLE results over the past 2 years! In 2024, we saw many of our children doing exceptionally well at PSLE and were placed in secondary schools of their choices. This is a testament of the hard work and dedication of our teachers and the support given to the children by their families.

    The children have also done well in Creative Areas. Our Modern Dance and Chinese Orchestra (Drums Ensemble) bagged <strong>Certificates of Distinction</strong> while the Guitar Ensemble received the <strong>Certificate of Accomplishment</strong> at the Singapore Youth Festival 2024. On the sporting front, our children have also won prizes in sports such as <em>Swimming, Athletics, Taekwondo, Squash, Tennis</em> and <em>Football</em>.

    Just like how the lyrics found in the school song described, the school is like a plant that has blossomed to become a big strong tree. This tree is supported by the deep roots of the 9 schools which formed its heritage. <strong>Farrer Park Primary School Version 2.0 (FPPS 2.0)</strong> is an amalgamation of 9 schools over 7 decades as depicted in the mural below.

  <p style="font-size: 16px;">
    As a school, we strive to give our children a balanced and holistic educational experience that will prepare them for a life of learning and thriving. Every child would be <strong>“A Fountain of Knowledge”</strong> with a <strong>“Heart of Gold”</strong>, as espoused by the school’s Vision, anchored on the school Values of <strong>Curiosity</strong>, <strong>Empathy</strong> and <strong>Care</strong>.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px;">
    I look forward to the new year. May we enter 2025 with a great sense of anticipation and hope, anchored on <strong>Values</strong>, working towards the Vision of the school.
