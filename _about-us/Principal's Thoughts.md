##### Follow that Rainbow!

            **Rainbows always have a very special place in my heart.**

  

I remember once, sitting alone on a bench by the lake in my university grounds one autumn, reading. It was a cool early evening after the rain. While I was reading, I suddenly felt the caress of the wind on my face and I looked up. Lo and behold, presented before my eyes was a full circle of rainbow, with stunning brightness from the sky to the crisp clear reflection on the lake. I was completely spellbound. Transfixed, I looked at the full circle of beauty and contemplated on the promises of rainbows. 

Then as a student and now many years apart, a Principal, the beauty I saw that evening never left my memory. Each time I think about it, I am deeply encouraged. Rainbows speak to me all the time and fill me with many hopes and dreams!

I look forward to another year full of beautiful rainbows for our pupils in 2019!  It is our hopes and dreams that each and every one of our pupils will find joy in learning; grow to become confident persons able to learn, unlearn and relearn; and to be caring leaders able to listen, empathise and serve. 

I want to encourage all our pupils (parents and community partners too!) to look to a year full of rainbows for yourselves. But rainbows come typically only after the rain and that means before we can have those beautiful rainbows, we must work very hard. Be adventurous - try different things, be prepared to fail but try again and again. There may be tough times, but we put in effective effort to learn well from the year’s experiences! I am very confident that we will find many rainbows through the year 2019!

Incidentally, one of my favourite quotes is also about rainbows!  It is the one by our founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew during a speech he made to the Singapore Press Club in 1996. The quote may be familiar to you:

                    “There’s a glorious rainbow that beckons those with the **spirit** 

                    **of adventure**, and there are **rich findings at the end of that**

                    **rainbow**. To the young and to the not-so-old, I say, **look at that**

                    **horizon, follow that rainbow**, **go ride it**.”

            So, to all Farrereans, this 2019, look at that horizon, follow that rainbow, go ride it… embrace the spirit of adventure!

  

With many warm thoughts
