Dear Parents,

As we welcome the new year of 2023, may the year bring us much joy and peace!

Farrer Park Primary School Version 2.0 (FPPS 2.0) is an amalgamation of 9 schools over 7 decades as depicted in the mural below. <br>

Just like the lyrics of the school song, the school is like a plant that has grown to become a big strong tree supported by the deep roots of the 9 schools which formed its heritage. I am glad to be part of this rich heritage having had the privilege of being a Principal of 2 other schools. 
Together with the Vice-Principals, Key Personnels, Teachers and support staff all with very rich and diverse experiences, we strive to give our children a balanced and holistic educational experience that will prepare them for a life of learning and thriving, that every child would be “A Fountain of Knowledge” with a “Heart of Gold” as espoused by the school’s Vision, anchored on the school Values of Curiosity, Empathy and Care.
I look forward to the new year. May we enter 2024 with a great sense of anticipation and hope, anchored on Values, working towards the Vison of the school.

In your service, 
Dennis Yap 
Principal
