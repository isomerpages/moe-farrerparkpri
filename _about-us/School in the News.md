**FPPS Chinese Teachers Featured on "Thumbs-Up" Publication**

<img src="/images/sitn12.png" style="width:60%">

Latest edition of the "Thumbs-Up" publication under Singapore Press Holding featured our school's Chinese teachers conducting a drama lesson on "Chang-Er and the Rabbit" with our Primary 1 pupils. In a twist to the story, pupils needed to think of ways to help Chang-Er in deciding whether she should forgive the Rabbit as the latter has eaten the mooncake meant to be kept for the Mid-Autumn celebration. Through the lesson, pupils learned to apply "Graciousness", one of the school values, in their words and actions.

Our pupils were featured by CNA Insider. You may view it below. CNA Insider She's 7 years old, came to Singapore only a year ago, and is gamely picking up English with the help of P1 classmates at Farrer Park Primary. Even before preparing for the PSLE, international students like Chaorui in neighbourhood schools must learn to adapt to local food and other integration challenges. But they're doing so with help from big-hearted classmates and the school. This is the story of 3 such students.
