### School Crest

<img src="/images/crest.png" style="width:40%">

The **open book** represents the key to knowledge and learning.

  

The **growing plant** depicts a child upholding the school's spirit of creativity, courage and flexibility.

  

The **three leaves** represent the School, Parent and Community.

  

Together they remind us that education is an **on-going process, best maximized** through the partnership.

### Our School Song

<figure>Like a plant<br>
We will grow<br>
Blossoming each day<br>
We will do our best in every way<Br>
We can be who we want to be<br>
By working hard<br><br>  

We’ll strive for excellence<br>
Integrity and honesty<br>
Here at Farrer Park Primary<br>
We’re challenged to be<br>
The someone we are proud to call me<br><br>

We will care<br>
We will share<br>
Helping those in need<br>
We will do our best in every deed<br>
We can be who we want to be<br>
By working hard<br><br>
  

We’ll strive for excellence<br>
Integrity and honesty<br>
Here at Farrer Park Primary<br>
We’re challenged to be<br>
The someone we are proud to call me<br>
Here at Farrer Park Primary</figure>
