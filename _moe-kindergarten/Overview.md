### MOE Kindergarten @ Farrer Park

<img src="/images/MK/MK_Photo.jpg" style="width:80%">

MOE Kindergarten @ Farrer Park was started in 2014 and was one of the first few MOE Kindergartens (MK) that were set up to provide quality and affordable preschool education to children. Over the years, many children have grown through the hands of our dedicated MK educators as well as through the MK curriculum. We aim to nurture children holistically so that they are confident, demonstrate strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy.  
  
MOE Kindergarten @ Farrer Park believes that every child can learn and use Mother Tongue Language (MTL) as an effective communication tool. Guided by this belief for children, the MK aims to cultivate children’s love and appreciation for reading of MTL books through our centre-based initiative, the MK Book Club. With child-initiated choice of books, children are motivated to read at their own pace.
