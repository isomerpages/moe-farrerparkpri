### ICT

<img src="/images/ict1.png" style="width:80%">

In FPPS, we strongly belief that technology should be a means to an end and not an end in itself. In this light, technology is used in the school to activate learners' curiosity and imagination, promote thinking and discussions as well as facilitate the application of learning. Teachers also actively use technology to assess students' learning, provide timely feedback and facilitate intervention for learning.

  

Our vision for every teacher is to leverage the affordance of technology to support classroom instruction so as to deepen students’ learning and keep them actively engaged during lessons. With Wi-Fi connectivity throughout the school, tablet computers and educational apps,  learning can already take place anytime,  anywhere - changing the way our students’  learn.

With the pervasive use of technology in teaching and learning, the school has also put in place a cyber wellness programme to ensure that students remain safe and use technology responsibly. The cyber wellness programme adopts the Think-Sense-Act framework to guide students in responsible use of technology. On this note, we would also like to encourage all parents to join us in ensuring that your child remains safe and responsible users of technology. Please visit the link below for resources on how you can manage your child’s online activities.  The resources will certainly help you to reinforce cyber wellness education at home.
