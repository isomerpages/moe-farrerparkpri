### Cyber Wellness sharing

Cyber wellness refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace. 

  

The school aims to educate students on ways to keep themselves safe while using the Internet at home and in school with the support of parents. To complement the cyber wellness curriculum in schools, parents can set a good example at home in the use of technology and play an active role in guiding our children to navigate in cyberspace.
