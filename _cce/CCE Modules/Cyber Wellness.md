### Cyber Wellness sharing

Cyber wellness refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace.&nbsp;

  

The school aims to educate students on ways to keep themselves safe while using the Internet at home and in school with the support of parents.&nbsp;To complement the cyber wellness curriculum in schools, parents can set a good example at home in the use of technology&nbsp;and play an active role in guiding our children to navigate in cyberspace.&nbsp;
