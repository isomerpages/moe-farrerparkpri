### CCE Lessons

#### FTGP

Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) is carried out weekly at Farrer Park Primary School. The main purpose behind FTGP is to provide protected time within the curriculum for form teachers to build positive relationships with their pupils.

  

During FTGP, game and play-based activities between form teacher and his/her pupils are carried out so as to build a safe environment for pupils and to enhance bonding between form teacher and pupils. There is also explicit teaching of social and emotional competencies.

  

#### CCE Lessons

CCE lessons are carried out during Mother Tongue periods in the various MT languages. Explicit teaching of knowledge, skills, values and SE competencies are imparted to the pupils to help nurture pupils of good character.
