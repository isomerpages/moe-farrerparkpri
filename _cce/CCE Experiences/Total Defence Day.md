# Total Defence Day 2024

The theme for Total Defence Day focuses on the many ways we can put Total Defence into action in our everyday lives. Total Defence remains relevant to deal with the ever-evolving threats and challenges to Singapore. These include misinformation, supply chain disruptions, and food security, which affect communities and Singapore's way of life. Every Singaporean has a part to play in our daily lives to ensure that Singapore is prepared for crises and disruptions and that we remain resilient and united.

Total Defence Day Commemoration at our school is an annual event that instills the importance of preparedness and resilience in our students. This year, we celebrated TD40, marking four decades of safeguarding our nation. Through engaging activities, we explored the six pillars of defence: Military, Civil, Economic, Social, Psychological, and Digital Defence.

During assembly, students watched a scenario video presentation, vividly illustrating the potential consequences of a major cyberattack, highlighting the significance of digital defence in today's interconnected world. Following this, an Energy Disruption Exercise raised awareness about the critical role of energy security in maintaining societal functions.

During recess, interactive activities encouraged students to reflect on personal contributions to Total Defence, fostering a sense of collective responsibility. Parents from the Parents Support Group played a crucial role in enhancing the recess activities by actively engaging with students and creating immersive learning experiences. Their involvement not only added depth to the activities but also fostered a sense of community support.

Additionally, the support of the Singapore Police Force officers further enriched the event with a vehicle and equipment display, offering students insights into safeguarding our country. These officers exemplify dedication and courage in their duty to prevent, deter, and detect crime. They serve as pillars of security in our society, instilling confidence in our students and reminding us all of the importance of collective defence and vigilance.
