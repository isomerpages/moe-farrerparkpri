# Total Defence Day 2024

The theme for Total Defence Day focuses on the many ways we can put Total Defence into action in our everyday lives. Total Defence remains relevant to deal with the ever-evolving threats and challenges to Singapore. These include misinformation, supply chain disruptions, and food security, which affect communities and Singapore's way of life. Every Singaporean has a part to play in our daily lives to ensure that Singapore is prepared for crises and disruptions and that we remain resilient and united.
