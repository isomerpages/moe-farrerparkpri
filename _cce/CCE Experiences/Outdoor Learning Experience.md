#### P1 OLE Hay Dairies

The P1 pupils visited Hay Dairies on 21 February 2019 as part of the English programme. They learn all about goats and farms in Singapore. They had the opportunity to watch the milking process and feed the goats. At the end of the trip, each pupil was also given a bottle of goat's milk to drink.
