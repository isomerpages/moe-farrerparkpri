#### Traditional Food Making Workshop

The school organised a traditional food making workshop for the P2 pupils in April 2022. The objectives of the programme were to create in pupils a greater awareness of the various types of traditional food in Singapore and to cultivate strong bonds of friendship between the local pupils and their international friends.
In this hands-on experience, pupils learnt to make the Epok Epok, Aval Urundai and Mooncake. They had an enjoyable time making and eating the traditional food!
