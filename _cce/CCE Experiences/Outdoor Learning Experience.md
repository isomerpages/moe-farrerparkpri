### P2
#### Traditional Food Making Workshop

The school organised a traditional food making workshop for the P2 pupils in April 2022. The objectives of the programme were to create in pupils a greater awareness of the various types of traditional food in Singapore and to cultivate strong bonds of friendship between the local pupils and their international friends.
In this hands-on experience, pupils learnt to make the Epok Epok, Aval Urundai and Mooncake. They had an enjoyable time making and eating the traditional food!

### P6
#### P6 Learning journey: Harmony in Diversity Gallery

In November 2023, the school brought the P6 pupils to the Harmony in Diversity Gallery where they learnt about Singapore's religious diversity and harmony. Pupils explored the different religions and their commonalities in practices and values. Pupils also learnt about the past incidences of religious conflict and tension in Singapore and what was done to develop and maintain religious harmony. This programme taught the pupils about what they could do to protect this precious legacy of harmony in Singapore.
