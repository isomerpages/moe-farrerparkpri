### P2

#### The Butterfly Lodge

Our Primary 2 pupils visited the Butterfly Lodge at Oh Farms on 4 May 2018. They learned all about butterflies and their importance in nature. The pupils went hunting for eggs and caterpillars. They were also thrilled when they got the chance to hold some caterpillars and stick insects. It was a new experience for many of our pupils. This OLE was part of the STELLAR book, “A Butterfly is Born”.
