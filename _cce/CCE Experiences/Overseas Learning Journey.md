### Overseas Learning Journey

自2013年起，我校的五年级学生赴北京参加“中国浸濡活动”。这次的活动为期5天。

我校的学生与北京的板厂小学和景泰小学的中国孩子共同上课。他们一起学习中文、书法、美术、戏剧、体育与历史知识等的相关课程内容；此外，学生还到北京著名的旅游景点（万里长城和故宫）观光，以达到提高中文水平、领略中国自然风光、感受中华文化。

这次的浸濡活动让学生获益不浅，也提高他们对华文学习的兴趣。

Since 2013, selected Primary 5 students have participated in a 5-day China Overseas Immersion Programme.

Our students visited Banchang Primary School and Jingtai Primary School in Beijing. They attended Chinese Language, Chinese Opera, Arts and Sports lessons and learned Chinese calligraphy and Chinese history. Students also visited famous tourist attractions (Great Wall of China and The Forbidden City) where they get to learn and immerse themselves in the rich Chinese culture and history.

As a result of this immersion programme, students have developed a greater interest in Chinese Language.
