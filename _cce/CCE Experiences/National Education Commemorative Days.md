### National Education Commemorative Days

#### National Education (NE)

National Education (NE) is important for nurturing future citizens – to inspire in our pupils a sense of belonging to the nation and guide them to be well-informed about local and global issues. Through NE, pupils learn to appreciate and commit to their role as responsible and caring citizens as well as establish a sense of national identity.
 

#### NE Commemorative Days

National Education (NE) is important for nurturing future citizens – to inspire in our pupils a sense of belonging to the nation.

The four core NE days which have been identified are significant as they are the defining moments in Singapore history. The aim is to entrench these events and the images they evoke in the consciousness of each successive generation.

#### Total Defence Day (TDD)

Total Defence remains especially relevant because the threats faced today require all Singaporeans to step up and play their part. Pupils are encouraged to put Total Defence into action in their daily lives by reaching out to one another, forging new relationships and strengthening existing ones to keep Singapore strong and resilient.

Through the commemoration of International Friendship Day, pupils learn that every individual in the country plays an active role in strengthening our ASEAN identity. Most importantly, pupils become more aware of the spirit of friendship and collaboration among people from different countries and its benefits on mutual inter-dependence.

On 21st July each year, schools commemorate RHD to mark the year of the 1964 racial riots. RHD serves as a reminder that Singapore’s harmonious society is built on a rich diversity of cultures and that every individual to play his or her part to promote social cohesion.
