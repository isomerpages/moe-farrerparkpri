### P6 Rivermonster Programme

The Rivermonster Programme is an environmental awareness programme which consists of a presentation of water and environmental issues such as scarcity and pollution. 
All P6 pupils will have a chance to observe, monitor and pick up litter from the shores of the Marina River. 
Pupils learn about responsible decision-making and that all of us have a responsibility towards keeping our environment clean.
