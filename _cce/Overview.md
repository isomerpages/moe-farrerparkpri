    CCE is at the heart of education at FPPS, shaping students into responsible individuals with a strong moral compass.<br><br>
    We strive to nurture lifelong learners who are not only of good character but also resilient, socially aware, and curious about the world around them.<br><br>
    With a spirit of curiosity and a heart of gold, our students will be ready to adapt and contribute meaningfully to society in a rapidly changing world.
