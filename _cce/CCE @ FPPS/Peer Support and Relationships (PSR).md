### Peer Support and Relationships (PSR)
<div style="background-color: #d2e1ce; border-radius: 10px; padding: 12px; font-size: 17px;">
<p><b>Peer Support in Our School</b><br>
At our school, we believe that caring for one another is everyone’s responsibility. Our <b>Peer Support Relationships (PSR) framework </b>is implemented through two levels of support, ensuring that every student is empowered to contribute to a safe, inclusive, and supportive school environment.</p>
	<p><b>Level 1 (L1): Every Student as a Peer Supporter</b><br>
All students are encouraged to be peer supporters across the three PSR domains through their everyday interactions and natural friendships. Support is often reciprocal, as students learn to look out for one another, offer help, listen with empathy, and include their peers. These simple yet meaningful actions help to strengthen positive relationships and foster a strong sense of belonging within the school community.</p>
	<p><b>Level 2 (L2): Peer Support Leaders (PSL)</b><br>
For Primary 3 to 6, selected students are trained to take on additional responsibilities as Peer Support Leaders (PSL). These student leaders help to look out for peers who may feel lonely or isolated and reach out to befriend and support them. They also provide a listening ear to students who may be experiencing difficulties, offering encouragement and care when needed.

As positive role models, Peer Support Leaders influence others by promoting positive mindsets, pro-social behaviour, and good character. Through their leadership and example, they help to strengthen a caring and supportive school culture where every student feels valued and supported.

Together, through both levels of peer support, we nurture a community built on empathy, care, and shared responsibility.
