The ALP and LLP provide opportunities for students to discover their strengths and interests, and to find greater relevance and motivation in their learning. They complement the schoolsâ€™ core academic and student development programmes, and help students acquire a broad and deep foundation for life and lifelong learning. The linkages with the industries and various community sectors also allow students to experience and connect with the world beyond the school. With a more diverse school landscape, students will be able to choose from a range of schools with various distinctive strengths.
