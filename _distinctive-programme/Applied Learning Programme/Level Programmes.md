#### C2IL@Farrer Park Level 1 Programmes 

<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Commemoration of World Water Day 2023</strong><br />
We kicked off the commemoration with an assembly programme presented by our students and teacher. Staff and students alike shared practices that they adopt to save water. The objectives of the school-wide activities were to help students recognize that water is a precious resource and that it is important to take proactive steps to tackle the global water crisis for water sustainability. This aligns with the Energy Reset pillar of the Singapore Green Plan 2030.</div>
