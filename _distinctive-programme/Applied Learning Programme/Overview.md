Since 2013, Farrer Park Primary has a specialised Drama-in-Education programme, iDREaM, \[I use DRama to EMpower (myself and others)\]. iDREaM aims to use drama to empower the pupils so that they can develop their communication and critical thinking skills and grow into confident individuals.  

  

Drama is used as a tool to teach the languages and character education. The key pillars of the programme are adapted from the United Kingdom and Ontario Drama Curriculum. The school has a 6-year plan to help all our pupils gain **exposure** through authentic learning **experience**s. The ones who show greater interest in drama as a performing art will be developed through the school’s **excellent** talent management programme.

  

In March 2016, the school’s niche in drama education was repositioned and recognised as an official Applied Learning Programme (ALP: Drama in Education).
