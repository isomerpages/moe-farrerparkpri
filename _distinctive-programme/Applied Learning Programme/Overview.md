#### Overview
<div style="text-align: justify;">At Farrer Park Primary School, our ALP aims to instil a greater awareness in our students of the environmental challenges that the world is facing today and provide them with opportunities to apply their knowledge and skills to overcome some of these real-world problems. Anchored on the theme of sustainability, Caring for the Community through Interdisciplinary Learning @ Farrer Park Primary School (C2IL@Farrer Park) is designed to enable students develop a deeper and better understanding of environmental challenges and the importance of sustainable practices through activities like interdisciplinary project work, enrichment programmes and learning journeys. Students become more engaged and informed citizens who are equipped with the knowledge and skills to make a positive impact on the world.</div>
