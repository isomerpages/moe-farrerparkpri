#### Lower Primary

The pupils from primary 1 to 3 go through a number of Process Drama lessons per term; whereby drama is used as a means to explore the story or a social issue providing pupils with an enriching language experience.

| # | The use of drama in teaching provides pupils with the experience of exploring social behaviour and the values that underpin it. Through the improvised drama process, pupils can investigate a wide range of real and imagined social issues through the safety of assumed roles or situations. |
| # | The drama lessons promote collaborative learning and creative problem solving as pupils take on different roles and perspectives to help the characters in the story overcome their challenges.  |

You can catch a glimpse of what a drama lesson is like from the video below.

Since 2015, English and Mother Tongue language teachers are also well-equipped with using drama strategies are to teach writing and oral. Pupils use drama strategies such as “freeze frame”, “hot-seating” and “role on the wall” to generate ideas for writing. The teacher will then facilitate the discussion in class to help pupils generate ideas and richer language for writing.

#### School-wide Process Drama & Character Education for Primary 1 to 6

  

Since 2014, the school has embarked on an annual school-wide process drama and character and citizenship education lessons that are linked to our school values.  Pupils from every class will explore the themes that are related to character education through a story. They work in groups, take on different roles to explore complex themes such as forgiveness, second chances, acceptance and selflessness.
