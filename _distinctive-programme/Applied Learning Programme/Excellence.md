<b>National Story Challenge</b><br><br>
Pupils who have been identified to have a flair for acting and public speaking would be encouraged to join the Drama Club. The Drama Club has been providing various platforms for the budding talents to build their skills and confidence as actors. <br><br>

This year, we sent 3 groups of pupils to participate in the National Story Challenge, a National improvisational storytelling competition, organised jointly by the National Library Board and Theatre Practice (a Theatre Company). 2 of the 3 groups were from the Drama Club and they did exceedingly well for the competition! We are very proud of our pupils who have demonstrated resilience and confidence throughout this competition!	<br><br>

The Drama Club is the chief anchor of excellence to the iDREaM programme. The Drama Club in FPPS aims to bring theatre to the community. <br><br>

  

The club is divided into two groups- Production group and Modular group.	<Br>
<img src="/images/exc4.png" style="width:60%">	<br>
	
Core members of the Drama Club form the Production group. They are involved in staging performances for the various school events that take place in the year. The budding talents of these members are developed through a structured actor training programme for the whole year.<br>	
<img src="/images/exc5.png" style="width:60%">	<br>
The Drama Club has been committed to bringing theatre to the community since it was formed in 2011. <br><br>

In March 2015, the Drama Club has gained yet another milestone for the school. We staged our very first ticketed public production “Forgiven- A Fairy Tale” at 16 Winstedt Road on 14 March 2015. After 6 months of rigourous training, our young actors have blossomed in their own ways and put up a spectacular show! The play was a great success and all 674 tickets were sold out! <br>

Here are some highlights from the production.

<b> Participation in Project Earth</b>	<br><br>
As part of our efforts of citizenship education in school, the Drama Club members play an active role in communicating the importance of recycling to the community.  <br><br>

For the past 2 years, we have been partnering National Environment Agency (NEA) to put up a skit on recycling at the Project Earth Roadshow. <br><br>

<b><u>Play Synopsis:</u></b><br><br>

It’s the year 2030, where everything is run by our dearest applications. Just like all of us, the apps go to school, or what is called the Playstore. Microsquash, a brilliant but lazy app, loves going to the Playstore… but only to hang out with her friends. In fact, she created a robot called Piknowcchio, just to do her homework! Looking just like a real boy, Piknowcchio meets a bunch of friends at the Playstore, and hears from them tantalising stories of toys and treats at the Apps Mall and Play World. There is just one problem - Piknowcchio is supposed to be hard at work at the Playstore! <br><br>

Farrer Park Primary School presents our biennial drama production -Piknowcchio's Playstore. Join Piknowcchio and his friends as they go on an app-ic adventure around the Apps Universe, where they finally learn that the road to success requires hard work.
