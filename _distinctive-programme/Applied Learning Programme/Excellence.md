25 actors, 16 dancers, 31 fringe performers and ALL our staff were part of our spectacular production- 'Piknowcchio's Playstore', which was staged at School of the Arts Drama Theatre on 5 August 2017. Both the matinee and evening shows were sold-out! Our young performers put up 2 dazzling shows for over 840 people. We're pleased to share with you some of the best moments from the play! <br><br>
	
<b>Drama Club Performance for Central Clean and Green Carnival</b>	<br>
Farrer Park Primary has been invited to participate in the launch of the Central Clean and Green Carnival organised by National Environment Agency on 19 November this year. <br><br>

The pupils from the Drama Club put up a play- Peggy the Pint-sized Pirate, at the carnival's launch to share with the members of the public the importance of reducing waste and the impact that littering has on the environment. The guest of honour for the carnival was the Minister of State for Health, Dr Lam Pin Min. <br><br>

The pupils had a fabulous time being Green Ambassadors as they advocated the importance of keeping Singapore clean and green at the carnival.	<br><br>
