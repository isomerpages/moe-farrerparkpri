In an ever changing world, it is critical for schools to prepare pupils for the future by equipping them with relevant leadership competencies and instil sound values through authentic and meaningful platforms.  
  
The “iCARE – Leaders of Tomorrow” programme at FPPS builds pupils’ 21st century competencies and develops them into Caring, Adaptable, Responsible and Enterprising (iCARE) leaders of tomorrow.  
  
All pupils in Farrer Park Primary School (FPPS) will be given leadership opportunities in all six levels under the Farrerean Leadership Programme. Pupils who show greater aptitude will be identified and developed further via the Star Leadership Programme.  
  
The Star Leadership Programme at FPPS is modelled after Kouzes and Posner’s Leadership Challenge Model. Pupils are given the opportunities to put the five practices of exemplary leadership - "Model the Way," "Inspire a Shared Vision," "Challenge the Process," "Enable Others to Act," and "Encourage the Heart" into action through carefully planned VIA learning experiences. This selected group of pupils will undergo additional leadership training and workshops to sharpen their leadership competencies.
