### STAR Leadership Programme

Pupils who show greater aptitude will be identified and developed further via the Star Leadership Programme. This selected group of pupils will undergo additional leadership training and workshops to sharpen their leadership competencies. The focus on leadership practices are key ideas extracted from Kouzes and Posnerâ€™s The Student Leadership Challenge Model.  
  
The aims is to prepare pupils for the future by equipping them with relevant leadership competencies and instil sound values through authentic and meaningful platforms.
