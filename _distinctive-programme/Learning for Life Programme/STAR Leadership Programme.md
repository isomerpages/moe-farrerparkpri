#### P4 and P5 Hosting Visitors from Hong Kong
 

On Wednesday,28 March 2018, a group of students and teachers from S.K.H. Yan Laap Primary School in Hong Kong visited Farrer Park Primary School. Some of our prefects from P4 and P5 hosted the guests. The prefects taught our guests to play Singapore’s traditional games like Chapteh, Adi Puli Aattam and Congkak. The guests also tried some of our traditional food like fruit cakes, sesame balls, vadai and kueh lapis. They also had the opportunity to observe some of the P5 and P6 lessons. It was a wonderful time of learning for our guests from Hong Kong and our pupils.
