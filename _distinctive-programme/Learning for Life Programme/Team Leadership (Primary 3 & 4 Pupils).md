#### P4 Visit to HCA Hospice Care ( HCA)

The P4 pupils visit the HCA Hospice Care (HCA) to interact and show care and concern towards the terminally ill. Prior to the visit, a school-based workshop titled “Touch of Love” was conducted by the facilitators from HCA. From this workshop, pupils learn interaction skills and plan mini interactive activities to be conducted during the visit. This can be in the form of performance or small group interactive sessions. The visit raises awareness in the pupils about eldercare issues and inculcates the value of empathy and respect emphasising on the importance of building intergenerational relationships.

#### P3 Sharing on Conservation to the P1 pupils

Integrated with the P3 EL STELLAR book on Stephanie Investigates, the P3 pupils had the opportunity to work in teams. They lerant the ways for effective communication when working in teams and to express oneself appropriately. The pupils shared their Information Poster on pollution, conservation on animals and environment with the message of caring for the needs of others. Armed with their team's poster, pupils presented and shared their learning with the P1 pupils and this in turn is linked to the P1 Great Little Helpers programme.
