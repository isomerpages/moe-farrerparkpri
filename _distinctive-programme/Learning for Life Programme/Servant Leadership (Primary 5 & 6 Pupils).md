#### Servant Leadership (Primary 5 & 6 Pupils)

##### Primary 5 – Learning Stations Facilitation

In primary 5, we went through a workshop which taught us how to communicate effectively and how to facilitate learning. The skills were put into use as they present information to visitors of the school where they are interacting with the children to share information and ideas while working in a respectful manner.

  

##### Primary 6 – Organising Game Booths

Every year, our school has an I&E Carnival where primary 6 pupils open game booths they have designed and created as a team after PSLE. Through a workshop on decision making and planning skills and the process of group work, they learnt the importance of working together in a respectful manner by sharing responsibilities and making decisions to meet the group’s goal.
