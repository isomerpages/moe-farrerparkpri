**National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS 2018)**

Our pupils participated in the National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS 2018) as well as Raffles Institution Primary Mathematics World Contest (RIPMWC 2018). The objective was to promote interest in Mathematics and develop problem solving ability through a friendly Mathematics contest for MOE Primary School pupils. The pupils were able to adapt to unfamiliar questions that challenged their critical thinking. These contests provided the pupils with a platform for the joy of learning mathematics for just pure fun. The pupils performed well, with Ashley Tan and Janelle Yew (both from P5RY, 2018) obtaining Certificates of Distinction for RIPMWC. Luke Png (P5RY 2018) and Janelle Yew obtained Bronze Certificates for NMOS.
