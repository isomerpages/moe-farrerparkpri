#### SYF 2017

**Category A - P1 & P2**

Title: Fly us there!

Artist Statement: How do we get to our favourite space? Fly there of course. We do it in the cheery, arty way with our pair of colourful wings. It would be great to have floating balloons attached to our wings. The colourful feathers of the wings are painted. Then, we mixed different colours of spray paint and use paper plates to create the planets which we would visit in our art journey.

**Category B - P3 & P4**

Title: Our Favourite Space  

Artist Statement\*: In our favourite space, we embark on an adventurous journey that leads us to our different creations and imaginations. The favourite space could be on our beloved couch, in our cosy bedroom or nature. Yet, we agree that this journey fosters the fun, laughter and endears the tower of friendship that we have forged together.

Title: Keeping the Dream Alive

We hope to take you on a journey to experience our favourite hobbies and places, intimate moments and precious keepsakes. The process of creating this artwork helps us to keep our memories alive.
